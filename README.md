# STRING MANIPULATION PROGRAM
This is a pretty simple Java commandline application which contains functions that alter a given string.

To run this program on Windows, download StringManipulator.jar and open command prompt.
Then, type:
```
java -jar <Your-downloads-path>\StringManipulator.jar
```
With my current setup I run it with:
```
java -jar C:\Users\Gjin\Downloads\IntegralCalculator.jar
```
After you download the file, you can move it anywhere and run it as long as you specify the path where it resides in.


## Main.java
Driver class which contains main() method.

## Recursion.java 
Support class which contains reverseString(), totalWord(), stringClean(), palindromeChecker(), and permutationHelper() methods.
